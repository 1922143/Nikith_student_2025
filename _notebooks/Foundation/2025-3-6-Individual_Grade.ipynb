    "At first, I wanted to be an Aerospace Engineer and I thought that computer science would play a big role on that career. However, after being open minded and doing a little research, I came to the realization that I could not be more wrong. My perspective was also changed when an aerospace student come to the student panel about a month ago and explained how he had to use github and a mapping API.\n",
    "\n",
    "After conducting so research I learned that aerospace engineering and computer science are deeply connected, driving advancements in flight and space exploration. Modern aircraft and spacecraft use AI, simulations, and real-time data processing for efficiency and safety. High-performance computing enables precise aerodynamic testing and design improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "I aspire to be an aerospace engineer, using coding and AI to develop smarter, safer, and more efficient aircraft and spacecraft for the future of exploration and travel."
