    "For Sprint 2, my team taught 3.1 and 3.5  and to prepare myself for CB and PBL, I participated during the other groups' presentations and tried my best to answer questions when asked. This was very helpful as I had very minimal knowledge on coding before enrolling for CSP so these lessons increased my knowledge on this subject and helped me prepare for the AP exam. I also made sure to complete the homework with proficiency and added some comments to explain my work. I prepared myself to teach logical operators for 3.5 by reading over the lesson and also looked it up on W3 schools to further develop my understanding on the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I taught 3.5 on  booleans and logical operators, I used the analogy of temperature, being too hot or too cold to help students visualize how to use the various operators. Because temperature is something that is easy to visualize, it can allow students to better understand how to use the correct operator. Other students, like Kanhay, were very engaged during our presentation and raised their hands. They also gave helpful feedback on the contents of our presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "One topic that I think that was very vital and I learned a lot about is strings and variables in python and javascript. I learnt this from lessons 3.1 and 3.4 from Aadi, Aaditya Katre, Kanhay, and Aditya Telepaddy. It was very interesting to learn about the various ways to define a variable or a string. I also think it was very important as it helped me in all the other lessons when I imported JSON, and created if-else statements and nested conditionals. That group also made the lesson very engaging and interesting by creating a quiz about variables and strings that I enjoyed answering. It was very rewarding to get a correct answer on the quiz and this aspect made it fun to participate.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sprint and big ideas were distinctly ours as we implemented optional quizzes to help students understand logical and relational operators. Another way we made it unique was by making our website purple and pleasing to look at. Something that displays my growth on these assignments is the homework assignments that I completed and the popcorn hacks to test my knowledge on all the lessons taught. Overall, I learned a lot from sprint 2 and all the lessons were engaging, allowing me to learn about python and javascript.   \n"
