    "# 1. Describe three dimensions of the digital divide and explain how each affects access to educational resources. Provide specific examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Economic Barriers: Many students from low-income families struggle with online learning because the cost of devices and internet access is simply too high. Without a personal laptop, students are left relying on public libraries with limited computer access and short hours. This creates a significant disadvantage compared to peers who can study from home at their convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Infrastructure Gaps: In rural areas, internet access is often slow, unreliable, or nonexistent. Students in these areas face major challenges in participating in remote learning, as they are unable to attend virtual classes or submit assignments on time due to inconsistent connectivity. The lack of reliable infrastructure severely impacts their ability to keep up with their coursework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital Literacy Deficiencies: Having a device doesn‚Äôt automatically mean a student knows how to use it effectively. Many students lack the skills needed to navigate online resources properly. Without a solid understanding of how to find credible sources or perform basic digital tasks, their work suffers, and they fall behind in an increasingly technology-driven world.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. Compare and contrast the digital divide challenges faced in urban versus rural communities. What solutions might be effective in each context?\n",
    "\n",
    "Urban Challenges: In cities, internet is usually around, but affordability is a whole different issue. Many low-income families just can‚Äôt afford the high prices. Making internet more affordable for students could make a huge difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rural Challenges: In rural areas, it's an entirely different. Sometimes there‚Äôs no internet at all, or the service is so bad that it‚Äôs impossible to do anything online. Students might even have to drive for miles just to find a decent connection, making remote learning an issue. Expanding broadband in these areas or providing mobile hotspots would change a lot for these students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Targeted Solutions: To actually close this digital divide, we need to think about what‚Äôs going to work for each community. In cities, the focus needs to be on making internet more affordable. In rural areas, we need to build up the infrastructure, so students can rely on steady, fast internet. A combination of government programs, tech company support, and local efforts is what‚Äôs going to make sure every student has the tools they need to succeed in this digital world."
