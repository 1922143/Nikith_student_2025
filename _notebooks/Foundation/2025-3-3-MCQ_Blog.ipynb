    "This means I need to focus the most on binary numbers and loops. Binary numbers are fundamental in computer science, so practicing conversions and operations will strengthen my understanding. Loops and random values are important for problem-solving in coding, so I should practice implementing them in different scenarios. Algorithmic efficiency will help me write faster and more optimized programs, while crowdsourcing is useful in collaborative problem-solving. To improve in these areas, I could not only take more practice tests but also work on small projects, watch tutorials, and try coding challenges to deepen my understanding."
