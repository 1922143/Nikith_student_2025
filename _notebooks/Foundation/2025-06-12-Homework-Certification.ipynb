    "\n",
    "Throughout the year, I developed both technical skills and a deeper understanding of the broader implications of computing. I learned how algorithmic decisions can reflect real-world biases, explored the ethics of open-source licensing, and practiced writing efficient and secure code. These lessons were not just theoretical; I applied them through hands-on projects and classroom discussions. By the end of the course, I gained the confidence to engage with computing critically and responsibly, not just as a programmer, but as a thoughtful contributor to the digital world.\n"
