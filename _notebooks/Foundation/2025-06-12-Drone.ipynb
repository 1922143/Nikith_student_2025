    "## üõ´ Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "- This project involved designing a multirotor drone using Onshape, a professional-grade cloud CAD platform.\n",
    "- The objective was to explore the mechanical structure and spatial layout of aerial vehicles while developing skills applicable to aerospace systems design.\n",
    "- My passion lies in the intersection of aerospace engineering and computer science. This project is the foundation for more complex work involving control systems, autonomy, and embedded programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üéØ Project Goals and Engineering Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary Goal: Create a modular, realistic drone design using engineering CAD principles.\n",
    "- Long-Term Vision: Prepare to integrate hardware (e.g., Arduino, sensors) and software (flight logic, control algorithms) to prototype an autonomous flight system.\n",
    "- Why Aerospace: I‚Äôm drawn to the challenge of designing systems that must operate with high precision, stability, and real-time processing‚Äîcharacteristics found in both aerospace hardware and software.\n",
    "- Future innovations: This design phase lays the groundwork for:\n",
    "  - Embedded systems programming (e.g., Arduino flight control)\n",
    "  - Sensor data processing (IMU, GPS)\n",
    "  - Autonomous navigation and software-based stabilization\n",
    "  - Possible use of ROS (Robot Operating System) in the future\n",

    "## üîß Design Process Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç a. Research and System Planning\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluated different multirotor types: quadcopters, hexacopters, and octocopters.\n",
    "- Chose a quadrotor design for its balance between simplicity and functionality.\n",
    "- Referenced real drone specifications (motor size, thrust-to-weight ratio, ESC layouts) to make the model physically plausible.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± b. Base Frame Construction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Created a symmetric cross-layout with parametric arm spacing to maintain center of gravity.\n",
    "- Designed the central hub to support a control board, power distribution, and frame rigidity.\n",
    "- Considered center of mass, moment of inertia, and air clearance during sketch phase.\n",

    "- Modeled with a modular mindset, similar to software architecture:\n",
    "  - Each component (motor, arm, ESC, controller) is treated like a function or class in a program.\n",
    "  - Assemblies mirror how we compartmentalize subsystems in CS (e.g., object-oriented structure).\n",
